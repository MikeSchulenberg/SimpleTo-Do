## Using the Application
The application interface has 2 main parts: the navbar and the to-do list itself. The navbar primarily displays information about the current user, such as username, the total number of to-dos marked as complete, and the number of Achievement Points earned by completing to-dos. The to-do list allows users to create new to-dos, edit or delete existing to-dos, and click checkboxes to mark to-dos as complete. The checkboxes are color-coded to indicate the priority assigned to each to-do: red for High priority, orange for Medium priority, and yellow for Low priority.

To start using the application, visit the [landing page](https://young-cliffs-56923.herokuapp.com/), then create a new account or sign into an existing one. Once on the main page, create a new to-do by clicking the text input marked "Add a new To-Do," which reveals the New To-Do form. Enter a description for the to-do, click one of the buttons to assign a priority, then click the Submit button to add the to-do to the list.
